OpenDarts
=========

The main goal for this project is building an OpenSource application for Darts Training.
Currently this project is in the very-early prototype state, be patient (or contribute).



A Platform
----------

This project is build upon the Eclipse Platform.
So I hope that adding new features should be quite easy (for an Eclipse RCP developper)

Some scorers module
-------------------

In the future this project should support few darts games I like to play during my training (Around The Clock, Capital, ...)


A statistics module
-------------------

In the future the application should contains a module to show basic statistics (average, best legs, ...)


Prototype
---------

For the prototype I will develop a quick (and dirty) application on the Indigo version.
The prototype will only contains the 501 scorer module upon the framework.


License
-------

This application is on the Eclipse Public License (1.0)
